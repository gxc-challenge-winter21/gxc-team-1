  We are glad to welcome you to our repository today. During the last three months (October 2021 - December 2021) we developed a concept how to integrate folding     bikes attractively and easily with public transport, especially in rural areas. For the implementation, we designed a digital prototype in the form of a mobile 
  app. The prototype is not meant to be a standalone application, rather it should be seen as an extension of the already existing <i>DB Navigator</i>-App.
