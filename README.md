  We are glad to welcome you to our repository today. During the last three months (October 2021 - December 2021) we developed a concept how to integrate folding bikes attractively and easily with public transport, especially in suburban areas. For the implementation, we designed a digital prototype in the form of a mobile 
  app. The prototype is not meant to be a stand-alone application, rather it should be seen as an extension of the already existing <i>DB Navigator</i>-App.

<p> In order to visualize the problem we created a Storyboard. The Storyboard helped to picture one of many problems and a solution within just six frames. <br> 
Another big problem the whole world is facing is the climate crisis: being able to enforce people to use public transportation and take a bike for the first and last mile can safe more than 120mg CO2 each kilometer.  
</p>  
<br>             

Therefor we challenged us to find a solution that covers especially the affordability and flexibility. Since the climate crisis is an inescapable topic, this topic is naturally included without extra mentioning. So we came to the following How-might-we-Statement:
                 
<p align="center">
                 <b>"How might we integrate foldable bikes in bundle options to make travel and commuting more affordable and flexible?"</b>
                                                                                                                                     </p>

We have been working steadily on our business model and the functionalities the prototype should have over the last weeks. <br>
Since <i>DB Connect</i> already offers the <i>Call a Bike</i>-Service where you can rent a bike minute-wise, we decided to focus on commuters. We definded commuters as those, who use the <i>DB</i> Train Service to go to work, but also everyone who takes the train regularly, be it on the weekend for a weekend trip or a holiday trip. <br>
