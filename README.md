# gxc-team-1 DiSoIs
Welcome to DiSoIs repository! This is a consistent work of all our team members: Isabell Menze, Jannik Schlomann, Markus Ertl and Austėja Vaičiulevičiūtė. 

Our team name stands for Digital Solution Infrastructure: we wanted our team to represent the idea of the challenge in general, so this abstract abbreviation was a perfect choice.

Our idea began with a pursuit to create an app that could be a part of existing Deutsche Bahn Connect apps and services, also covering the convenience and sustainability aspects. The result is an upgraded DB app with additional functions: presenting the folding bike service and bundle options.
