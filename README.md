  We are glad to welcome you to our repository today. During the last three months (October 2021 - December 2021) we developed a concept how to integrate folding     bikes attractively and easily with public transport, especially in rural areas. For the implementation, we designed a digital prototype in the form of a mobile 
  app. The prototype is not meant to be a standalone application, rather it should be seen as an extension of the already existing <i>DB Navigator</i>-App.

<p> In order to visualize the problem we created a Storyboard. The Storyboard helped to picture the problem and solution within just six frames.</p>

We have been working steadily on our business model and the functionalities the prototype should have over the last weeks. <br>
Since <i>DB Connect</i> already offers the <i>Call a Bike</i>-Service where you can rent a bike minute wise, we decided to focus on commuters. We definded commuters as those, who use the <i>DB</i> Train Service to go to work, but also everyone who takes the train regularly, be it on the weekend for a weekend trip or a holiday trip. <br>

In order to extend our prototype to the needs of the customers we did some user testing. Many thanks to the 19 particpants. <br>
