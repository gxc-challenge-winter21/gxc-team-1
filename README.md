# gxc-team-1 DiSoIs
<p align="center">Welcome to DiSoIs repository! This is a consistent work of all our team members: <br> Isabell Menze, Jannik Schlomann, Markus Ertl and Austėja Vaičiulevičiūtė. </p>

Our team name stands for <b>Di</b>gital <b>So</b>lution <b>In</b>frastructure: We wanted our team to represent the Idea of the Challenge in general, so this abstract abbreviation was a perfect choice.

Our idea began with a pursuit to extend the existing Deutsche Bahn Navigator app covering the convenience and sustainability aspects. The result is an upgraded DB app with additional functions: presenting the folding bike service and bundle options.
